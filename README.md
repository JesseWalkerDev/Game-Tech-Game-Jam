# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, December 2024

## Theme
We decided that the player should be able to reverse gravity to fit the "reverse" theme.

## Game Play
This a 2D platformer where the player must jump over obstacles and flip gravity to travel to the end of the level.

## Impediments
Difficulty programming and adding effects, as well as difficulty using GitHub

## Implementation
* Player character that can move and jump
* Hazards that reset the player
* Objects the player can touch to reverse gravity
* Smooth camera that follows the player
* Music and sound effects
* Start and end menus
